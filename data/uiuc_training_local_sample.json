The two groups have complementary strengths that provide important synergies and opportunities for both entities to do more than they could individually. Although there are minor barriers that hinder collaborative work, these can be navigated well if one knows what to expect. Probably the most important task for us all is to maintain channels of communication, find areas where we share interests, and identify important scientific problems that can be addressed via collaborative projects. It's likely there are good opportunities that require both sides to stretch a bit, think outside the box, and try things that carry some risk. There will be plenty of time for discussion, so please come prepared with your ideas and suggestionsDownload Flyer: http://isgs.illinois.edu/sites/isgs/files/seminar/ISGS_SeminarFlyer_20190325.pdf  About the speaker Dr. Johnson has been at Illinois in the Department of Geology for over 22 years, and has served as department head for almost eight years. His research interests lie in water quality studies, stable isotope geochemistry, and the development of novel \"heavy stable isotope\" measurements to trace contaminant sources and detect chemical reactions that control contaminant mobility and impact.",

Or, as they say in the industry, \"merch.\" So it's important for musicians to spend time carefully considering what merch they should sell, how to get it designed and manufactured, and how to market it to their fans. \r\n\r\nSo join Bobby Owsinski, as he teaches musicians how to make money selling their own merch. He explains which products are the most profitable (and which never sell well), and offers some product ideas you might not have considered yet, like tour books. Plus, learn the best places to order merch, how to price your products, and how to run a successful merch table at shows or on tour. Bobby wraps up with a look at online merch sales, either directly through your band's website or through a third-party company such as Bandcamp or Topspin Media.",

We'll share strategies and best practices from research-based pedagogy. Great conversations and handouts provided. Session 3:What and How Am I Grading? Is it Fair? Helpful? (Part B)\"Is your grading consistent?\"\"What kind of feedback is helpful?\"\"If you have TAs, how is their grading?\" The task of assessing and grading student learning is one of the most complex and stressful responsibilities of the faculty member and, at the same time, one of the most important. In this two-part session, we will address both constructing a valid assessment (Part A) and grading fairly (this session). It is critical that the grading process is fair, reliable, valid, and relevant so that the resulting grade is an accurate representation of a student's achievement. When done properly, the grade and accompanying feedback are additional teaching opportunities where students can improve their learning.  In this highly interactive session, we will learn a grading process so that our grading is fair, consistent, and manageable and ways to provide effective feedback to our students.*This workshop counts towards completion of any of CITL's Teaching Certificates.

            "resource_description" : "Paul Morin, who leads the Polar Geospatial Center at the University of Minnesota, will be presenting a seminar \"An Embarrassment of Riches: We now have better topography for the ice on Earth than the land\" on Wednesday, March 11 at 1:00 p.m. in the NCSA auditorium. Abstract: For years, those of us that made maps of the poles apologized. We apologized for the blank spaces on the maps, we apologized for mountains being in the wrong place and out-of-date information. Over the past 10 years the situation improved. An image mosaic of Antarctica was built, airborne RADAR produced an improving view under the Antarctic ice sheet and a constellation of satellites started to stream data at ever higher resolution, at an increasing tempo and even during the long polar winters. Now a diverse collaboration of U.S. science and intelligence agencies, universities and a geospatial software company has produced REMA--the Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica--and ArcticDEM, using open source software to extract Digital Elevation Models (DEM), or digital topography, from licensed imagery on Blue Waters at a resolution of two meters. The data have an accuracy of a foot and repeat coverage of 90% of the poles an average of 10 times over six years. This project was too large for any one agency, university or company. It required a large allocation on Blue Waters, four satellites that continuously collected sub-meter optical imagery for five years, two satellites that produced ground truth, 100Gbit networking and petabytes of storage. We never thought that we would ever see a time when the science community has better topography for ice than land. Even we, the creators of REMA, are having a difficult time understanding what we have made. The use of it in logistics and facilities management was a surprise. We are as dumbfounded as anyone at the degree to which subsurface topography is expressed in ice sheet surface features. Incredibly, the volume of data and temporal depth of the DEM coverage is causing all of us to reassess how we manage and analyze geospatial in general. We now apologize to the polar science community for a different reason. They have to keep up. And the current DEMs are only the beginning. We now face an avalanche of imagery and derived products in an increasingly complex landscape of small-sats launched by the dozen. It is a complex, exciting time.",

This course is designed to change that, providing a baseline understanding of databases and their mechanics. Adam Wilbert covers normalization, a table structuring technique that reduces data redundancy; primary, foreign, and composite keysâfeatures supporting the table relationships that underlie relational databases; and indexing, which helps speed up data retrieval. Along the way, Adam will provide tips for working with SQL Server Management Studio and some challenges to help you practice what you've learned.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNote: This course will also prepare certification candidates for the \"Understanding data storage\" domain of the Microsoft Technology Associate (MTA) Exam 98-364, Database Administration Fundamentals.

In this trying time of COVID-19, when faced with having to cancel our usual in-person disABILITY Resource Expo, our committee decided to offer an alternate way for individuals with disabilities and their families to obtain much-needed resource information. We have planned a series of four monthly, virtual events - mini-expos, if you will - that will feature a given sector of resource organizations. Each event will include an overview of all featured exhibitors, followed by a chance to speak with exhibitors in Zoom \"breakout rooms,\" and ending with a featured exhibitor presentation. All will be held on the Third Thursday of the month, from 3:00 - 4:30 p.m. We are hopeful that many of our local families will be able to participate. Dates/Topics are as follows:Oct 15, 2020: Healthcare &amp; EquipmentNov. 19, 2020: Self-Help/Support Groups &amp; Vocational/Residential/Recreation ServicesJan. 21, 2021: Advocacy, Legal &amp; Service OrganizationsFeb. 18, 2021: Education Services &amp; Services for Young ChildrenInformation on how to register for the next (November 19, 2020) TTRR event will be announced soon.",

            "resource_description" : "Abstract  I feel honored to give the 2019 Soo Distinguished lecture, especially since I am an academic grandson of Professor Shao Lee Soo, who was the advisor of Professor Chang-Lin Tien, my PhD advisor.  My acceptance of this invitation sparked a question in my mind: How do mentors shape our research and career, and what have I learnt from my experiences? Many individuals deeply influence our ideas and career, most importantly our students and post-doctoral fellows, as well as our family. However, mentors hold a very special place because they inject their academic DNA in us, such that we often inadvertently find ourselves approaching challenges and opportunities in research and, more broadly, life, like our mentors.  In my career, I have been blessed by many mentors, but two of them stand out because of how closely and long I worked with them. The first is, of course, Professor Chang-Lin Tien, and the second, much later in life, is Professor Steven Chu. They have several common characteristics - an incredible openness and ability to quickly absorb knowledge from a wide spectrum of fields, beyond disciplinary silos; fearlessness in moving into new and different fields and connecting the dots between them to create something new; tough-mindedness, hard work and determination to dig deep into a research topic based on internal convictions, regardless of whether the topic is fashionable or not; maintaining a high bar for excellence and perfection in whatever they do; handling students, post-docs and collaborators with the utmost respect, transparency and with their best interest in mind; and an undaunting passion to serve the people for a meaningful cause. In addition to these invaluable traits, they have both underscored research opportunities by pushing the extremes - length, time, energy, mass. This has become an underlying theme of my research.  With this context in mind, I will discuss our work to explore of extremes of nanometer-scale thermal, electronic, optical and fluidic phenomena, which were catalyzed during my graduate days with Professor Chang-Lin Tien and continue even now. Professor Steven Chu introduced me to the field of climate change and a sustainable energy future, arguably the defining challenge of the 21st century, and one which is at the global scale involving gigatons of CO2. I will discuss some of our thinking and work in this realm as well.  Host: Professor Sanjiv Sinha",

Bitcoin has been in the news lately as the OG crypto asset bounces back up into all-time-highs on the trading market. This meeting we will discuss the origins of Bitcoin and its emergence after the 2008 financial crises. Has it fulfilled the vision of the creators and original participants? Has it taken on a new role in our society? How do other Blockchain projects compare to Bitcoin in operation and purpose?Bring your curiosity and questions as we explore these ideas!This is group is for anyone interested in distributed ledger technology (i.e. blockchains, cryptography, smart contracts, decentralized applications (DApps) cryptocurrency/tokens, and relevant related subjects). Everyone is welcome! We will meet once a month and will have an educational component as well as a discussion component at our meetups. Join if you seek to learn about this industry and have a great time!Our group is affiliated with the Blockchain Special Interest Group of the Association for Computer Machinery at the University of Illinois. Blockchain SIG members help manage the group, provide informational sessions, and coordinate special events.For more information on this event, check out our Meetup Pagehere.Be sure to check out the rest of our monthly tech meetup groupshere.If you have questions, or need accommodations for this event, please contact Cathy McArthur at mcarthur@illinois.edu.",

            "resource_description" : "Abstract: During the last decade, our understanding of soft matter has been transformed through the synergistic consolidation of theory, computer simulations, and experiments into a materials design engine (platform). In this talk, I will describe how this approach has guided synthesis towards programmable molecular architectures to yield novel functional materials with well-controlled physical properties. In particular, I will demonstrate how theory and computer simulations have empowered the design of polymeric networks capable of replicating the unique self-assembly, mechanics and temporal evolution of living tissue. These synthetic tissue mimics are vital for biomedical device engineering and embody significant implications for decoding a multitude of cellular processes including proliferation, locomotion, and differentiation. This interdisciplinary approach has also driven the discovery of a graphene exfoliation mechanism utilized in synthesis of superabsorbing and conductive polymer/graphene foams.

            "resource_description" : "Abstract: Understanding how humans and machines learn from few examples remains a fundamental challenge. Humans are remarkably able to grasp a new concept from just few examples, or learn a new skill from just few trials. By contrast, state-of-the-art machine learning techniques typically require thousands of training examples and often break down if the training sample set is too small. In this talk, I will discuss our efforts towards endowing visual learning systems with few-shot learning ability. Our key insight is that the visual world is well structured and highly predictable in feature, data, and model spaces. Such structures and regularities enable the systems to learn how to learn new tasks rapidly by reusing previous experience. I will focus on two topics to demonstrate how to leverage this idea of learning to learn, or meta-learning, to address a broad range of few-shot learning tasks: task-oriented generative modeling and meta-learning in model space. In addition, I will discuss some ongoing work towards building embodied robots in the wild, especially on streaming computation with bounded resources.

On campus, you could usually find me splitting between hanging out at Firehaus (a now closed bar that had karaoke), grabbing a burger at Joes, or furiously working in a Siebel conference room. I grew up in the Bay Area, and after graduation returned here to join Rubrik, an enterprise data management startup. Then, this past April, I joined Siteline, a construction-tech startup, as a SWE and the 5th employee - Joel Poloney, another alumni, is actually one of the founders of the company. Previously, I interned at Uber and VMWare. While I am currently a SWE, I've heavily considered consulting, product management, and VC roles so I'm happy to talk about any of those. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, sports of all kinds (both playing and watching), and reading fantasy/sci fi books.

            "resource_description" : "More Letters into the \"AI\" Acronym - \"A\": Active, Adversarial, \"C\": Covert, Causal, etc. Abstract: With the ever-increasing role of AI for supporting the operation of complex systems, several new capabilities are recognized as critical to realize the premised value of AI. Examples include the ability to determine the best actions to maximize economic benefits, to develop an understanding of anomalous behavior and its root cause, and to differentiate between genuine and malicious behavior, etc. This talk will provide an overview of some of these capabilities and the gap analysis that must be addressed with new AI algorithmic developments. Next, the talk will focus on \"Active AI\" and discusses two of its applications. In one application, active AI covertly builds cognizance about a complex system operation to support its safety and security. In another application, it interacts with the system in order to better-learn its behavior and subsequently better-optimize its operation. An example using Reinforcement Learning in Additive Manufacturing is provided. Bio: Hany was bornin Alexandria Egypt where he obtained his pre-college education and a Bachelor degree in Nuclear Engineering from Alexandria University in 2000. Immediately after that, he accepted an offer to continue his graduate studies at North Carolina State University (NCSU), where he worked on computational reactor physics for boiling water reactors. Following graduation, he moved to Lynchburg, VA where he worked for AREVA-NP in their methods group on fuel loading pattern optimization for pressurized water reactors. In 2007, he started a tenure-track position at NCSU, where he was jointly funded by the Idaho National Laboratory. One year after obtaining his tenure in 2013, he moved to Purdue University in the school of nuclear engineering. He is currently focusing on data mining applications in the context of reactor safety, economy, and cybersecurity. Hany is also an entrepreneur; he has formed a start-up company (Covert Defenses, LLC) based on Purdue IP to commercialize an AI-based technology to protect the network and software of critical infrastructure systems.",

            "resource_description" : "Monte Carlo Multiphysics Applications in Nuclear Engineering Abstract: Nuclear reactors represent tightly-coupled physics interactions between thermal-hydraulics, neutronics, material performance, structural mechanics, chemistry, and more. Multiphysics modeling is the practice of accounting for these physics interactions during design and analysis. Recent advancements in high performance computing now enable multiphysics simulations with state-of-the-art Monte Carlo neutron transport and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools. This talk will begin with a high-level overview of the most important coupled physics interactions in fission reactors, and then introduce the theory of multiphysics modeling as most commonly applied in nuclear engineering. Current research in Monte Carlo-based multiphysics applications will be summarized in terms of acceleration strategies, stability, field mapping, and software development. Then, multiphysics methods research at Argonne National Laboratory using high-resolution CFD and Monte Carlo tools will be presented; example applications of NekRS, OpenMC, and MOOSE to pebble bed reactors, sodium fast reactors, and prismatic gas reactors will highlight state-of-the-art multiphysics methods research. Finally, student opportunities at Argonne National Laboratory for graduate students will be introduced. Bio:Dr. April Novak is the Maria Goeppert-Mayer Fellow in the Computational Sciences Division of Argonne National Laboratory, where she conducts research in multiphysics modeling and simulation, computational thermal-hydraulics, and multiscale methods. April is the lead developer of the Cardinal application, an open-source software tool that couples the NekRS Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and OpenMC Monte Carlo codes to the MOOSE framework. As part of her PhD research, April developed multiscale methods for pebble bed analysis within the coarse-mesh thermal-fluid Pronghorn MOOSE application. She now leads several projects in the high-resolution multiphysics space with applications to fast reactor core radial expansion and gas microreactors, and supports a broad range of nuclear industry collaborations. She has a PhD in nuclear engineering from the University of California, Berkeley (2020) and a B.S. in nuclear engineering from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (2015).",

            "resource_description" : "Abstract This presentation will focus on three aspects of so-called Taylor bubbles, large volumes of gas rising in vertical tubes. In the first part a method is demonstrated which permits to considerably accelerate the rise velocity of Taylor bubbles by inserting coaxially with the tube a \"cage\" of equally spaced vertical rods. The physical principle of the phenomenon is explained and the results demonstrated numerically. The presentation then turns to the blow-out phenomenon responsible for many disasters in off-shore drilling such as the Deepwater Horizon Macondo blow-out in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The mechanism underlying these phenomena is explained in physical terms supported by numerical simulations based on the drift-flux model. Finally, the instability of the axial symmetry of Taylor bubbles in a vertical tube when exposed to a liquid downflow is considered and the role of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in the process elucidated.  About the Speaker Following his departure from the Johns Hopkins University after several decades of service as C.A. Miller Jr. Professor of Mechanical Engineering, Andrea Prosperetti is currently a Distinguished Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Houston, with a part-time appointment as Berkhoff Professor of Applied Physics at the University of Twente in the Netherlands.

In fact, it treats <em>all</em> of its data as vectors and matrices, so the course starts with a basic linear algebra tutorial outside of the program before describing essential analytical skills performed using MATLAB. Instructor Curt Frye covers creating MATLAB scripts, accepting user input, extending MATLAB with user-defined functions, controlling flow with conditional logic and loops, managing text strings and other data structures like numbers, performing advanced plotting, and summarizing data using statistical analysis functions. By the end of the course, data scientists such as engineers and economist should be able to effectively use MATLAB for numerical analysis, data modeling, and data visualization.",

            "resource_description" : "Abstract: Nanomanufacturing, defined as \"the production of materials and structures with at least one lateral dimension between 1 and 100 nm\", has been showing potential for revolutionizing a variety of research fields, including the biomedical, electronics, optics, energy, and materials fields. Interestingly, studies related to the manufacturing of nanoscale structures on pre-formed 3D surfaces are still in their infancy, and most current approaches are focused on generating nanoscale 3D structures. However, the recent rapid growth in the flexible and wearable electronics industry demands scalable and efficient nanomanufacturing processes that can be directly applied to 3D surfaces. The existing approaches, developed mainly for 2D surfaces, face significant challenges to address such needs to deal with complex 3D profiles. This talk will present a novel electrohydrodynamic (EHD) driven nanomanufacturing method, named Self-Aligning Nanojet (SA-N), to enable direct patterning of functional nanofibers on non-planar surfaces. The talk will cover precise patterning methods of nanofibers on 2D surfaces using Droplet-Jet mode Near-field Electrospinning (DJ-NFES) and expand the scope to 2.5D and 3D surfaces. The key achievement in terms of hardware and software will be discussed as well as the challenges to broaden the technology into nanoscale additive manufacturing on 3D surfaces.  Bio: Dr. Chang is an assistant professor in the department of mechanical engineering at the University of Utah. Before joining the University of Utah in 2015, Dr. Chang was a postdoctoral fellow in the physics department at the University of California, Berkeley, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), and in the Kavli Energy Nanoscience Institute. He obtained his B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Yonsei University's School of Mechanical Engineering in Korea in 2005 and 2007, respectively. He received his Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2012. Dr. Chang also spent one year as a postdoctoral scholar in the school of dentistry at the University of California, San Francisco. He is currently a director of the wearable NEMS laboratory, and his research focuses on advanced micro/nanomanufacturing using functional low-dimensional materials for various applications including flexible and wearable electronics.

Join George Maestri in this course to learn how to use Unity scripting, animation, and UI tools to enhance the interactivity of your designs. Review the basics of scripting, including working with variables and functions. Learn to apply scripts directly to objects in your scene and trigger them with a single keystroke. Next, discover how to animate interactions, such as opening doors and drawers, and adjust how animations are triggered with colliders and proximity detection. Finally, George shows how to create a simple user interface for your scene, adding buttons, menus, and sliders that allow the viewer to control object visibility, lighting levels, and more.",

Hence, managing potentialdisruptive events of an engineered system and therefore improving the system's resilience is animportant yet challenging task. To ensure system resilience after the occurrence of failure events, thisthesis proposes mechanisms across different phases: design, operation, and failure recovery.As for enhancing the designs, challenges have arisen due to the increasing scale of modern systemsand the complicated underlying physical constraints. To tackle these challenges, we present agenerative design method that utilizes graph learning algorithms. The generative design frameworkcontains a performance estimator and a candidate design generator. The generator can intelligentlymine good properties from existing systems and output new designs that meet predefined performancecriteria. While the estimator can efficiently predict the performance of the generated design for a fastiterative learning process.Besides, during the operation stage, intentional islanding is commonly applied in practical applicationsand attracts abundant interest in the literature. Thus, we propose a hierarchical spectral clustering-based intentional islanding strategy for interconnected systems. And various system onlinemeasurements are used as embedded information in the clustering algorithm to enrich the modelingcapability of the proposed framework.Moreover, we establish a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) based failure recovery frameworkusing heterogeneous dispatchable agents. The scenario-based stochastic optimization (SO) techniqueis adopted to deal with the inherent uncertainties imposed on the recovery process from nature. And theCVaR risk measure is implemented because of the temporal sparsity of the decision-making. Theresulting restoration framework involves a large-scale MILP problem and thus an adequatedecomposition technique i.e. modified Lagrangian dual decomposition, is also employed to achievetractable computational complexity.We consider case studies for complex engineering systems, such as synthetic supply chain networksand power systems from the IEEE dataset to illustrate the applicability of the proposed methods forimproving system resilience.",

AE Guru Ian Robinson starts you off by working with Character Animator templates. Then it's time to build characters with custom controls for animation, such as subpuppet attachment points and layer handles. Ian then shows how to drive animation with your mouse or touchscreen device, and control facial expressions, mouth positions, and body parts like hands, arms, and legs. He even shows you how to map keystrokes to drive animation in real time with body and head rotation or advanced physics simulations.

Sustained efforts in the engineering of controllable quantum systems and high-fidelity quantum measurement have driven these theoretical concepts into the domain of practical experimental science. In this talk, I will present evidence that the physics of quantum error correction is also a generic, emergent property of quantum many-body systems. Using toy models based on random unitary dynamics interspersed with projective measurements, I will describe precise connections that exist between fundamental notions of quantum error correction, such as the channel capacity, and the presence of a phase transition in these models as one tunes the measurement rate. I will then show how to define a local order parameter for this transition that is defined by the ability of the system to protect initially local quantum information for exponentially long times. This construction points to scalable probes of the transition that are immediately applicable to quantum computing platforms such as trapped ions or superconducting qubits. Studying this class of measurement-driven many-body dynamics may ultimately lead to more efficient realizations of scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computing, as well as deepen our understanding of the transition from quantum to classical physics in many-body systems.",

            "resource_description" : "Stability is often the most important factor in catalyst discovery and improvement. In this seminar I discuss our groups recent work modeling the stability of two important classes of materials and sets of conditions: transition metal carbides during synthesis, and zeolite supported metal cations and nanoparticles under different hydrothermal conditions of practical interest. Transition metal carbides are attractive catalysts because they have catalytic properties similar to Pt-group metals. However, their synthesis is complex, often traversing through multiple metastable phases during nucleation. We use quantum chemical calculations, thermodynamic analyses, and comparison to a large body of experimental data, to show that control over nanoparticle size is a key factor in phase selection during carbide synthesis. Next, we apply similar computational machinery to the more complex system of Pt and Pd cations and nanoparticles supported on zeolites, which are used as catalysts for a wide range of chemical reactions, with various and distinct active site requirements. Consequently, sintering and redispersion processes that interconvert cations and nanoparticles underpin activation and deactivation of these catalysts, yet the influence of the nanoparticle size distribution, gas conditions, zeolite topology, and cation identity on the thermodynamic and kinetic factors influencing such interconversion are not well-understood. We use a combination of computational analyses and experimental validation to elucidate the conditions that generate a favorable thermodynamic driving force for agglomeration or redispersion and use kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the rates of interconversion. Our results show that water, a ubiquitous molecule in practical applications of these materials, promotes agglomeration of cations into nanoparticles for both Pt and Pd, even under high-temperature oxidizing conditions.",

Explore default routing policies on Juno, policy structure and terms, policy match, and the process for importing and exporting policies. Finally, review firewall filters, including filter match criteria, match types, and actions.<br><br>\r\n\r\nCompleting all three courses in the series will help prepare you to pass the related 65-question certification exam, JN0-102.",

White introduces tools from within and outside the SDK to speed up and automate unit testing. White also looks at mock objects, which help test code when real objects are unavailable (for example, a yet-to-be-created class).

When it comes to computer-aided facilities management (CAFM), there is one tool: AutoCAD, Autodesk's flagship CAD platform for Windows and OS X. Get the skills you need to use AutoCAD to calculate available area, understand which percentage is usable space, and export drawings and data for analysis and presentation. Concentrating on the basics, this course guides you step-by-step through a realistic CAFM project, allowing you to learn at your own pace and develop your skills as you go. Author Shaun Bryant shows how to set up drawings, define and measure areas, set up facilities area tables, and annotate drawings. By the end of the course, you'll be able to export the information to applications such as Microsoft Excel, so you can analyze the data in a tabular format.",

In this course, you can learn a workflow for moving models between ZBrush and CAD packages that use SubD (subdivision surfaces), such as Rhino. Instructor Jean Gorospe shows how to build incredible designs that take advantage of both their strengths-and prepare for an exciting 3D printing process known as stereolithography (SLA). Follow along and discover how to build a modern task chair in Rhino, transfer the model to ZBrush for high-res detailing, send the mesh back to Rhino to convert it to NURBs, and finalize the design for printing. Jean even shows you what the results look like coming straight off an SLA printer, and after they've been washed and cured.",

            "resource_description" : "Overview We study the problem of online learning in competitive settings in the context of two-sided matching markets. In particular, one side of the market, the agents, must learn about their preferences over the other side, the firms, through repeated interaction while competing with other agents for successful matches with preferred firms. We propose a class of decentralized, communication- and coordination-free algorithms that agents can use to reach their stable match in structured matching markets. In contrast to prior works, the proposed algorithms make decisions based solely on an agent's own history of play and require no foreknowledge of the firms' preferences. Our algorithms are constructed by splitting up the statistical problem of learning one's preferences, via noisy observations, from the problem of competing for firms. We present two specific algorithms -- one based on Upper Confidence Bounds and other based on Thompson sampling -- both of which, under realistic structural assumptions on the underlying preferences of the agents and firms, incur a regret which grows at most logarithmically in the time horizon. Our results show that, in the case of matching markets, competition need not drastically affect the performance of online learning algorithms.

How do we close the current knowledge gaps and embark on a discovery plan?The autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulates all the critical physiological functions of the heart (chronotropy, dromotropy, inotropy, and lusitropy). This system is composed of central components, intrathoracic components, and intracardiac components. While the central and intrathoracic ANS has been well defined the \"heart's little brain\" remains a subject of intense investigation. The aim of the field of neurocardiology is to develop tools to characterize the structure and function of the human neuro-cardiac nervous system (NCNS) in health and disease. This would enable us to identify new therapuetic targets to address therapeutic gaps in the treatment of the most common cardiac and vascular diseases.",

Author Ryan Kittleson shows how to hollow out models, define an object's thickness, and work with texture maps for full-color prints. He shows you how to export the model, upload it to Shapeways, and view the finished result. Once you have mastered the basics, Ryan invites you to test your skills in a series of challenge videos.",

            "resource_description" : "Abstract: In this talk I will overview my career journey starting as a graduate student at Illinois in 2006 to now, as a manager and researcher at IBM Quantum. As a part of this journey, I performed graduate research in two countries, shifted topical area in my postdoc (from AMO to superconducting qubits) and made the transition to industry. I hope to share some of my experience and lessons learned. I will give a very brief overview of superconducting qubits and what it's like to work as a quantum computing researcher in industry. Bio: Dr. David C. McKay is a research staff member and manager at IBM Quantum in Yorktown Heights, NY where he has been since 2015. At IBM he has focused on two-qubit gate development for superconducting qubit devices and various topics in quantum characterization, calibration and verification. He was involved in several aspects of IBM's open source quantum software project, Qiskit, including the development of the characterization package (\"Qiskit Ignis\") and the language for full time-dependent control of qubits (\"Qiskit Pulse\"). Prior to IBM, he was a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Chicago in the group of Prof. David Schuster where he researched novel couplers for superconducting qubits. He received his PhD from the University of Illinois, splitting time at the University of Toronto, where he studied ultracold Bosons (Rb-87) and Fermions (K-40) in optical lattices.",

            "resource_description" : "Abstract  To function effectively, living cells compartmentalize myriad chemical reactions. In the classic view, distinct functional volumes are separated by thin oily-barriers called membranes. Recently, the spontaneous sorting of cellular components into membraneless liquid-like domains has been appreciated as an alternate route to compartmentalization.  I will review the essential physical concepts thought to underly these biological phenomena, and outline some fundamental questions in soft matter physics that they inspire. Then, I will focus on the coupling of phase separation to elastic stresses in polymer networks. Using a series of experiments spanning living cells and synthetic materials, I will demonstrate that bulk mechanical stresses dramatically impact every stage in the life of a droplet, from nucleation and growth to ripening and dissolution.  These physical phenomena suggest new mechanisms that cells could exploit to regulate phase separation, and open new routes to the assembly of functional materials  Bio  Eric Dufresne is the Professor of Soft and Living Materials at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in ZÃ¼rich (ETH). His research focuses on the physics of soft materials. Current topics include interfacial properties, mechanics, and self-assembly in biological and synthetic systems. Before moving to ETH in 2016, Eric was a graduate student at the University of Chicago, a post-doc at Harvard University, and a professor at Yale University.  Host: Professor Randy Ewoldt",

The Bullet dynamics solver, an open-source physics engine, is a great solution, and it replaces Maya's legacy rigid-body and soft-body toolsets. Fast and efficient, Bullet is highly optimized and integrated into the existing Maya toolset. In this course, Aaron F. Ross shows how to set up and direct Bullet simulations for collisions, breakage, and simple cloth effects. Learn how to create simulations with polygon objects; work with dynamic and passive rigid bodies; integrate dynamics with keyframes, constraints, and soft bodies; and use rigid sets to create breakage simulations. Aaron will also show how to leverage Alembic data for faster baking, caching, and importing and exporting.",

He will then go over detailing (adding color, shading, and textures) to further enhance the sense of perspective in your drawings.

            "resource_description" : "Abstract: Training AI agents for complex problems, such as controllable content generation, requires integrating all sources of experiences (data, cost, constraints, info of related tasks) in learning. Past decades of research has led to a multitude of learning algorithms for ingesting different experiences. However, creating solutions based on such a bewildering marketplace of algorithms demands strong ML expertise and bespoke innovations. This talk will present an alternative approach to creating solutions from a unifying perspective. I will show that many of the popular algorithms in supervised learning, constraint-driven learning, reinforcement learning, etc, indeed share a common succinct formulation and can be reduced to a single algorithm that uses different experiences in the same way. This allows us to create solutions by simply plugging arbitrary experiences in learning, and to enable new learning capabilities by repurposing off-the-shelf algorithms.

Sass is the adopted and widely supported CSS compiler for WordPress, which allows you to use variables, mixins, and nesting to write simpler code. In this course Morten Rand-Hendriksen covers practical workflows for incorporating Sass into the development of a WordPress theme, along with Grunt.js, a task runner that translates Sass code into browser-friendly CSS. First Morten walks the viewer through a full production setup, including implementation of version control, Grunt.js, Ruby, and Sass on Windows and Mac. Then he'll present practical workflows for developing a custom theme (based on the _s or Underscores theme) with Sass and shipping \"pure CSS\" versions to the public.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNote: This course doesn't teach Sass itself. To learn more about the language, watch <em>CSS with LESS and Sass</em>.",

He starts by showing how to prepare a project for mixing, from importing tracks to organizing them visually. Skye then discusses working with Logic's mixer: controlling signal flow, working with plugins, and using sends and returns, groups, and the master output. Next, Skye dives into mixing a song, covering balance, equalization (EQ), dynamics and compression, reverb and delay, automation, and bouncing down the mix. Finally, Skye covers mastering techniques, including applying EQ, compression, and limiting; setting the song order; and understanding how concepts like bit depth, sample rate, file formats, and dither affect sound quality.",
